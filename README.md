This is the backend for Taskly, a task management app. At this stage, the backend mainly handles user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and securely access the app.

The backend is built to be simple and easy to extend. It includes basic routes for account creation and login, and it ensures that user data is stored and managed safely. Authentication is handled using JWT/session tokens, and passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.

This setup lays the foundation for future features like task creation, updates, and reminders. As the project grows, more endpoints and functionalities will be added to support the full task management experience.

For now, this backend serves as the entry point for user access and security in the Taskly app.
